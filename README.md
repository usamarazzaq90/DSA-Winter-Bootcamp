# üöÄ DSA Roadmap  

Welcome to the **DSA Roadmap**! This repository is a curated collection of problems and resources designed to help learners build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to sharpen your skills, this roadmap provides a systematic way to approach DSA concepts.

---

## üìñ **General Instructions**  

1. Start with the most-easiest problems.
2. DO NOT try to solve each problem yourself, instead try to learn and understand how different problems are being solved.
3. Do not try to solve a problem for more than 1 hour initially to get fast and to achieve more in less time, for any problem taking more than 1 hour, put it in a backlog and solve it later.
4. Average time to solve a problem should be 30-45 minutes.
5. Do not try to solve a lot of problems from one topic, instead try to solve 5-10 problems per topic.
6. Do not try to jump into problem-solving directly without the necessary prerequisites, For example
     If you are trying to solve a problem that requires HashSet/HashMap then make sure you have studied HashMap before solving the problem.
